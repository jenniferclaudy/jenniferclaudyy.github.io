        <p class="end">
        A text is a sequence of words. A text stays the same no matter how it’s rendered.
        Consider the sentence “I like pizza.” I can print that text on a piece of paper, or
        read it aloud, or save it in a file on my laptop. It’ll be the same text, just rendered
        different ways—visually, audibly, digitally.
        </p>
        <p class="end">
        But when “I like pizza” is printed, typography gets involved. All visually displayed
        text involves typography—whether it’s on paper, a computer screen, or a billboard.

        Is typography an art? That’s like asking if photography is an art. Some photographers
        and typographers use techniques that raise their work to the level of art. But at
        their core, both photography and typography have a utilitarian function. The
        aesthetic component is separate. Being an effective typographer is more about good
        skills than good taste. And you can learn the skills.
